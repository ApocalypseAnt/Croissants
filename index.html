    <h1>What are Croissants?</h1>

    <p>
      A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/,[3] US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French:
      [kʁwasɑ̃] (audio speaker iconlisten)) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie
      pastry of Austrian origin,[1] but mostly associated with France.
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other
      viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[4] Croissants have long
      been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries.
      The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late
      1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
      dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled
      labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a
      French response to American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008, 30–40% of
      the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
      frozen dough.[6] Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast
      in many European countries.
